# Project_Flashcards
A FlashCard App

This is a flashcard app. This allows people to create and edit their own decks. Functions include being able to edit, add, and delete cards. Also users are able
to edit the name and description as well. Also if needed, users are also able to add new or delete decks they want to. 

When "studying" a deck, users will be able to flip the card over for answers and click "next" after they are shown the answer. Once the user is at the end of the 
deck, they can start over or go back to the home.

They project uses React and Javascript. It also utilizes bootstrap for styling purposes. 

I hope you enjoy the app!
